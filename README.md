# QD4CSP: Quality Diversity for Crystal Structure Prediction

`QD4CSP` is the first of its kind implementation combining the strengths of Quality Diversity algorithms
for inorganic crystal structure prediction. 

This project is the result of the _MSc Thesis_ project completed as part of the _MSc Artificial Intelligence_.
It was supervised by Dr Antoine Cully, with expert materials science input provided by Professor Aron Walsh, 
Chair of Materials Design at the Department of Materials at Imperial College London.
